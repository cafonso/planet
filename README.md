# Planet Ruby

Feed list/configuration for [Planet Ruby](http://planetruby.herokuapp.com)

Note: All feeds including the feed lists (that is, [ruby.ini](ruby.ini) and friends)
get auto-updated (fetched) once a day (that is, every 24 hours).


## Add Your Feed - How To

Step 1: Add your feed to the feed list (that is, [ruby.ini](ruby.ini) or friends).


Example:

~~~
[zenspider]
  title  = Ryan Davis (Polishing Ruby)
  link   = http://blog.zenspider.com
  feed   = http://blog.zenspider.com/atom.xml
~~~

Step 2: There's no Step 2 ;-)

That's it. Wait for the next auto-update (max. 24 hours). Welcome on Planet Ruby.
